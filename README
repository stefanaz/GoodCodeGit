First project GutCode with GitHub.

Source for the analysis was taken from SAVE version: 
/data/zenith234d/stefan/tmp/save_20_01_14/GutCode/libraries/GutLib/

-- checked on Jpsi MC sample, creating mini CN -> working good for a few Jpsi files.
-- prepared first commit with at least compiled files, and with src for 20_01_14  -> prepare first vesion commit : v0.1
-- cleaned workdir from unused and test files.
-- create mini CN from 05e data and compare results with 05e dta from Danny and from my new src version
	-- created mini_nt "mini_HeraII_05e_Data_only_Dimuon_Finalversion": 
	file smallntuple.root is identical to the oldest version src/ for production of this file
	BUT it is still different from primary file from Danny => need check for comparison both files.
	-- compared by Runnr and Eventnr ; Found that my smallntuple.root is the identical part of Danny. Danny has somehow more events. 

Going to check: 
-- find new Danny cat. 

-- check mini CN production with 03p , 04p data separately
	-- at the end => prepare all new mini_nt for v02 (*1)
-- check running the analysis -> histo productions
-- update src/ to latest version
-- prepare version submit v0.9_test
	-- check with consistensy of results
	-- make all tests (subsets, secvtx, dimuon histoses, run_all, finalyze all)
-- prepare version submit v1.0

-- create a clone GoodCodeGit repo on NAF mashines.
	(*1*) -- run miniNT production for all data 

-- create a new branch with : create new dir for saving all plots automativcally from all parts of analysis 

-- create a new branch 1.1 : CS developing
	-- make CS creating from the simple ground.

-- create a new branch with a Fitter.
